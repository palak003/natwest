## Overview
This project is a CSV processing application built using Spring Boot. It processes CSV files containing student data, checks their eligibility fetched from cache, and stores the results in a database. The application utilizes microservices architecture,and Swagger for documentation.To boost speed of application batch processing and multithreading has been implemented.
Microservices communication has been managed using open-feign client.

## Features
- **CSV Processing:** Upload CSV files containing student data for processing.
- **Eligibility Check:** Check eligibility of students based on predefined criteria such as marks in specific subjects, and can be managed dynamically.
- **Database Storage:** Store the processed data in a database.
- **Multithreading:** Process multiple CSV files simultaneously using multithreading for improved performance.
- **Swagger Documentation:** Explore and test the APIs using Swagger UI.

## Microservices
The project consists of the following microservices:
1. **CSV Processing Service:** Responsible for processing CSV files and checking eligibility.
2. **Database Service:** Manages the storage of student data in the database.
3. **Eligibility Service:** Defines and manages eligibility criteria for students.

## Usage
1. **Upload CSV Files:** Use the provided endpoints to upload CSV files containing student data.
2. **Check Eligibility:** Invoke the eligibility check API to determine the eligibility of students based on predefined criteria from cache, and criteria can be dynamically changed as well.
